# Peer-Programming a Buggy World with ChatGPT AI

AI has been all the rage lately, with solutions like Stable Diffusion for image
generation, GPT-3 for text generation, and CoPilot for code development
becoming publicly available to the masses.

That excitement ramped up this week with the release of
[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), an extremely impressive chat-based AI
system leveraging the best GPT has to offer.

I decided last night to take ChatGPT for a spin, to test its code-generation
capabilities. And I was astonished by the experience.

Together, we built a simulation of bugs foraging for food in a 100x100 grid
world, tracking essentials like hunger and life, reproducing, and dealing with
hardships involving seasonal changes, natural disasters, and predators. All
graphically represented.
